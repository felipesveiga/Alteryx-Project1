# Alteryx Bootcamp Project

<p>This is a project carried out for the Udemy´s <a href='https://www.udemy.com/course/alteryx-bootcamp/'>Alteryx Bootcamp</a> course.</p>
<p> I played the role of an analyst from a wholesale organization. It was demanded that I should perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul> 
  <li>
      Insert the data from the August´s sellings file into the company´s Orders dataset. 
  </li>
  <li> 
      Update the client´s data in the Customers table with the use of the August transactions spreadsheet´s informations.
  </li>
</uL>

<p> The result of the assignment was a workflow that accomplishes both asked jobs.</p>
